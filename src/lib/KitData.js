          "New research from the up-close Grand Finale orbits of NASA’s Cassini mission shows a surprisingly powerful interaction of plasma waves moving from Saturn to its moon Enceladus. Researchers converted the recording of plasma waves into a “whooshing” audio file that we can hear -- in the same way a radio translates electromagnetic waves into music. Much like air or water, plasma (the fourth state of matter) generates waves to carry energy. The recording was captured by the Radio Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument Sept. 2, 2017, two weeks before Cassini was deliberately plunged into the atmosphere of Saturn.",

          "If you're squeamish, you may not want to listen to the strange whistle of ultra-cold liquid helium-3 that changes volume relative to the North Pole and Earth's rotation. When ultra-cold liquid helium-4 was squashed through an array of tiny apertures, a phenomenon occurred in which the helium-4 repeatedly sped up, slowed down and vibrated. This produced a 'quantum whistle' -- a whistling sound that went from high to low.",
