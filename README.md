## Description

Sample Space is an educational-minded drum machine that explores the sounds of SPACE, as sampled by NASA. Featuring 3 distinct kits, users can create sequences that delve into the bounds of our known universe and even beyond in an accessible and fun learning environment. 

Users can play these drum kits with either keyboard or mouse, once focused on the main PLAY window. Sample Space also features a discrete sequencer, which each step can be toggled on or off with a simple click and comes with hand-crafted sequences to pique the user's imagination!

Our featured stretch technology for this project incorporated the Reactronica library to control audio as a function of state.
